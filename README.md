**Just take advantage of this time saving**

You just need to replace your folder by this one. 

The achievement ask to run 960 kilometers ; With this save, you'll be at 959km ^^ 

1) Reach C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\dying light 2\out\storage and you'll find a folder with an ID (like "44b4e3744d0141f78f3804a354a3e84b"). It's your ID
2) Save your actual folder in a safe place
3) Then, just replace it by this folder 
4) Start the game, run 1km and unlock the achievement
5) Leave the game
6) Take back your save to keep your profile, your progress, your weapons etc.

If you got any issue, let me know ; We have tried with a friend and it worked.
